            "content_html": "<p>Kyaikhtiyoe Pagoda, also known as Golden Rock, is one of the main pilgrimage sites for local people, you don’t want to miss that place as it is one of the top ten destinations in Myanmar. Only 4 hours drive from Yangon, the pagoda is situated on the mountain cliff, only 18 ft. height. It is strongly believed as a wishful stupa. If you love short trekking, do that from Kimpun Base Camp or you can now have the cable car ride from Yathae Taung to the top of the mountain, where the stupa is. You can do the day trip from Yangon but we totally recommend to stay overnight there for it’s breathtaking sunset and sunrise views. If you are here in March, that’s the perfect time for it’s Pagoda festival.</p>",

Although most of them believe in Christianity and Buddhism, Animism is also still being practiced, a lot of stone tombs and sacrificial poles can still be seen. The town is famous for its beautiful trekking trails to villages, greeny hill-side plantations and mithun farming. Visiting to face tattooed ladies houses and having the chat with them in person is the best part. Organic fruits are super delicious here. Traditional clothing and smoked mythan meat are the best presents to home from this beautiful city.</p>",

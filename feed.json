Visiting to the villages near by the lake and explore how the ethnic people make their livings, it’s just unique of life here.</p>\n<p>Hiking up the beautiful green hills near by, tasting the wine on the mountain top, getting lost in the caves, getting fresh and clean air when you are having a ride on the boat and seeing the leg-rowing technique of the fishermen and the floating island and the houses on them are just worth visiting, what would you need more! Shan noodle of course you should never miss to try which is the most popular food in across Myanmar!</p>",
